# Portfolio Demo – CD FullStack

Welcome to the demonstration project of Carine Dupuis!

## What's this site?

No unicorns here (well, maybe...), but an interactive, modern, and responsive portfolio designed to showcase my web & mobile developer skills. This site is a showcase of my expertise, my projects, and my passion for code (and short nights).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Three.js, CSS Modules
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Other**: Vercel, Expo, Firebase, and a good dose of creativity

## Features

- Project showcase (with links, QR codes, and more)
- Animated 3D tech stack (yes, to shine at parties)
- Dark/light mode (for vampires AND early birds)
- Multilingual: French, English, Spanish

## Why this project?

To show what I can do, plain and simple!

## Disclaimer

This site is a demo: no personal data, no contact form that sends emails to NASA. Just fun, code, and a bit of magic.

_Thanks for visiting! If you smiled at least once, mission accomplished._
